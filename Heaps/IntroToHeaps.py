#Mainly used to implement a priority queue

heapq.heapify(nums) #converts a list or any iteerable into a heap or priority queue

#heappush(heap, ele): This function is used to insert the element mentioned in its arguments into a heap. The order is adjusted, so that heap structure is maintained.
#heappop(heap): This function is used to remove and return the smallest element from the heap. The order is adjusted, so that heap structure is maintained.#
heapq.heappush(nums, 0)
print(nums)  # Output: [0, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3]
smallest = heapq.heappop(nums)
print(smallest)  # Output: 0
print(nums)      # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]

#Replace the smallest element with a new value and adjust the heap:
heapq.heapreplace(nums, 6)
print(nums)  # Output: [2, 4, 3, 5, 6]


#Pythonâ€™s heapq module only supports a min-heap. 
# To create a max-heap, you can invert the values by multiplying them by -1 when inserting or removing elements.

#You can use heapq to efficiently find the smallest or largest elements in a list.
#using nsmallest and nlargest
nums = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
k = 3
print(heapq.nsmallest(k, nums))  # Output: [3, 4, 7]

#Efficiently merge multiple sorted lists into a single sorted list using heapq.merge

heapq.heapify(list) makes a list a min-heap based on priority values --O(N)
